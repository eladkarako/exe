quick and dirty shellexecute in C#,
max are 3 arguments all strings:
first is file - doesn't have to be full path.
second is single string of arguments.
third is verb (open/print/printto/openas/runas/runasadmin/...)

two arguments only apply file and arguments (verb is whatever it is in default)

one argument only apply file.

no arguments program ends.
